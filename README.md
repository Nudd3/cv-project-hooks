# CV-Project-Hooks

## About

A CV-creator project where the user enters some information about him/herself followed by whatever education and experience the person possesses. 

So I did this CV-creation project using React class components, and now I did a similar one but instead used functional components. Mainly to get the hang on how react state works when hooks comes into play, hence the name..

This project was done as a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Fullstack JavaScript curriculum and more precisely the React section of that curriculum. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Git/GitHub

## Takeaways
Getting the hang of the React way of doing things certainly took some time. However I really enjoyed the introduction of hooks. Although I far from understood the stuff immediately, the amount of resources found online surely helped me through the fire and the flames.
